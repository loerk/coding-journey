### **How to** use this Journal :trumpet:

Actually, its not for you!   
 
Anyway, you are very welcome to have a look... but have in mind that this is more as a re*mine*der for myself and for taking track on what i learned so far. I am updating it every now and then. If you are seriously interested in that you can check it out [here](https://loerk.github.io/coding-journey/index.html)  

>*Sidenote* : Its not responsive yet. 
So don't even think about opening it on your mobile devices ;)
