        <h3>Liability for contents</h3>
        <p>
          The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care.
          However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness
          of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
          content on these pages in accordance with the general laws pursuant to
          § 7 Para.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not
          obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored
          third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
          illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
          information under the general laws remain unaffected. However,
          liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at
          which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become
          aware of any such infringements, we will remove the relevant content
          immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Liability for links</h3>
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on
          whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
          liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
          operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
          linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
          violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
          recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of
          the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
          evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any
          infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Copyright</h3>
        <p>
          The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages
          are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing,
          distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond
          the scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent
          of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site
          are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the
          content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
          of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is
          identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
          copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become
          aware of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>
          The use of our website is generally possible without providing
          personal data. As far as on our sides personal data (such as name,
          address or e-mail addresses) are collected, this is as far as possible
          on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties
          without your express consent. We point out that data transmission over
          the Internet (eg communication by e-mail) security gaps. Complete
          protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
          The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint
          obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited
          advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited.
          The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal
          action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
          information, such as spam e-mails.
